# Application of Support Vector Machines for damage detection in industrial products

Code accompanying my master's thesis.

### Abstract
Through the years of technical evolution, people have found ways to introduce classification into a wide variety of fields, from healthcare to industrial
production. Support vector machine is a machine learning algorithm used
for the purpose of solving classification tasks. It’s ability to handle datasets
with high-dimensional data samples through the usage of the so-called kernel
trick, together with resulting model’s capability to adapt to new data, keeps
this method relevant through the fast-developing space of machine learning
trends. This thesis uses support vector machine algorithm to solve a problem
of damage detection in industrial products. Several types of kernels together
with different sets of hyper-parameters were analyzed. Model that results in
the highest accuracy uses the linear kernel function, with said accuracy being
96.59%.
